<h2> Project 4 Digital Design </h2>

<p> For this interactive assignment, I chose to use a piece of clay that my friends and I had previously bit into. It just so happened that we also recorded each of us biting into the clay, so it seemed like a perfect opportunity to show the process of creating the clay bite. </p>

<p> Below is a photo of the piece of clay that was bit into by the four of us. </p>

<p> Below is a photo of the breadboard and the buttons for this project. Each mouth plays a different girl's video. </p>

<p> Below are each girl's videos that were played on the projector when one of the buttons was pushed. </p>
