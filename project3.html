<h2> Project 3 Digital Design </h2>

<p> With the recent election results weighing heavy in the air, it was hard for me to think of anything other than that while creating this video. Every video I watched, my mind somehow tied back to the anxiety about the next four years and how things would change. I titled my video American Fear. I edited many clips together that I thought expressed the fear I was feeling in these times and hopefully captured some other people's points of view as well. Most of the video portrays the fear felt by a woman rather than a man, though. I didn’t want to start incorporating community fears that I was not a part of, like the LGBTQ+ community or the POC community, as it felt insensitive and like I didn’t have enough information to articulate it properly. There is a lot of talking in this video, as I find words really impact me more than videos. There are small narratives within the video, but the composition is very much a fast-moving montage. </p>
